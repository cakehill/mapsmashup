<h3>Google Maps and News Readme</h3>

<p>This site was built on a MAC with BBEdit and was tested to display and work properly with Firefox 2, and Safari 3.1.  I also did a test on IE7 and Firefox 2 on a PC with Windows XP.  All showed up as I expected them to.</p>

<p>I decided not to use the stored procedures that were offerred with the assignment - I noticed in the phorum that David said this was ok.  And I also did not rely on Googles looking up of the lat/long values, as they were quite different than the $5 table.  So for consistency sake, I pulled everything from that zipcode table.  The code first does a lookup of the requested zipcode and centers the map on that page.  It next finds the boundaries of the map and narrows down the query to the database, only finding zips that fall within that call.  The nice thing about this was that I could use the same file.  I just had to pass in different querystrings and with that, I had different WHERE clauses.  I also decided to show a random selection of 10 results with the query.  For me, that seemed to be just fine - not overloading a page with too many markers that were very close to each other.  This helps when the map is zoomed way out - it randomally populates the maps.  And when the search is in close and there are less than 10 results, this does not matter. </p> 

<p>With the $5 zipcodes table, there are many rows that have the same long/lat value as it only shows two points after the zipcode.  This was resulting in many more calls to the database than should be.  The way you could tell was the shadows of the markers would turn quite dark if there were more than one overlayed.  The way I handled that was to group the the sql query by long/lat, this removed the duplicates.  If in the future there is a more precise zipcode table, the only thing I would have to do would be to remove that group by clause.</p>

<p>All in all an interesting project, took a while to get my hands all around it.  I tried to create as many javascript functions as seemed possible for common code.  Is there anything else you can see that I could have combined or done differently?</p>
