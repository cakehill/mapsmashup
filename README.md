# mapsmashup
A mashup using the Google Maps API and Google News. Enter in a zipcode and the map will re-center, giving you some options to click on to get the top ten news items for that area. A PHP file takes the zipcode and polls a MySQL database returning an XML file of the coordinates and re-centering the map while the same zipcode polls Google News and the display overlays atop the map. The project makes uses of Yahooâ€™s YUI JavaScript library to make the AJAX calls.
